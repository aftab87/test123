# Git Demo Application

This is a minimal Python application to help you practice basic Git commands such as clone, commit, branch, merge, and pull requests.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x (already installed on most systems)

## Running the application
```bash
python main.py
```
You should see the output:
```
Hello, Git! This is a demo application.
```

## Suggested Git workflow for practice
1. Fork or clone this repository.
2. Create a new branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/my-change
   ```
3. Make any edits (e.g., modify `main.py` to print your name).
4. Stage and commit your changes:
   ```bash
   git add main.py
   git commit -m "feat: personalize greeting"
   ```
5. Merge or open a pull request to integrate your changes.
6. Explore other Git commands such as `git log`, `git diff`, and `git rebase`.

Feel free to experiment and break thingsâ€”this repository is meant for learning!
